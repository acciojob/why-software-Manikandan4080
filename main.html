	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		Software development can be a significant creative outlet. In this role, I can create practically any type of software product I want on a computer. I will also have to find creative ways to solve problems through coding. While I spend a lot of time writing technical code, there is still a lot of creativity involved, especially if I get to work on my own projects.
